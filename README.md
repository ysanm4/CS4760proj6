This is the README for project 5 made by Yosef Alqufidi

How to run this project:

To run this project you will first need to compile oss.cpp and worker.cpp in this file. The two files that exist are a c++ worker file and a c++ oss file.

Step 1, Compile: In the command line type "make" which will compile both the user and the oss file.

Step 2, Running the files: After you compile with make, run ./oss -h to display the help menu.

Step 3, Running oss file with other parameters: Now you can try running oss by running ./oss -n 3 -s 2 -i 100 -f logfile.txt. You can also select your own parameters. Make sure to include -f with all inputs so it could work.

Step 4, Checking logfile: Make sure to open logfile to check it's contents. Keep in mind if you just run ./oss with no parameter inputs, the log file will be named ossLog.txt.
